Babysitter Kata

Background
----------

This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night. The rules are pretty straight forward:

The babysitter

- starts no earlier than 5:00 PM
- leaves no later than 4:00 AM
- gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
- gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
- gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
- gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)

Feature:
--------

As a babysitter In order to get paid for 1 night of work I want to calculate my nightly charge.

Update:
-------

Note that the original requirements do not mention when bedtime is supposed to be.  This, I imagine, is set by the parents rather than left to the babysitter.  Since children who need babysitting are very young, I'll set the bedtime to something early: 8:00 PM.
